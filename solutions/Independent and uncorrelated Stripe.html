Say we have two random variables X and Y.
What does it mean for X and Y to be independent?
What about uncorrelated?
Give an example where X and Y are uncorrelated but not independent.
<br>

Independent means knowing the value of one random variable does not give you any information about the other.<br>
I.e. $P_{X|Y}(x|y) = P_{X}(x)$<br>

Uncorrelated means that there is no linear relationship between X and Y.<br>
I.e. $\rho = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{Var(X)Var(Y)}} = 0$ or equivalently $Cov(X,Y) = 0$

The classic example is $X \sim N(0,1)$ and $Y=X^3$.<br>
Clearly knowing $X$ gives you $Y$ so this is not independent.<br>
Or knowing $Y$ changes the distribution of $X$.<br>
We can show that this is uncorrelated by showing $Cov(X,Y)=0$.<br>
$\begin{aligned}
Cov(X,Y) &= Cov(X,X^2)\\
&= E[(X-E(X))(X^2-E(X^2))]\\
&= E[X^3]-E[X]E[X^2]\\
&= E[X^3]\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^3p(x)\\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{0}x^3p(x) + \int_{0}^{\infty}x^3p(x)\\
&= -\int_{0}^{\infty}x^3p(x) + \int_{0}^{\infty}x^3p(x) \text{ by Symmetry}\\
&= 0
\end{aligned}$
