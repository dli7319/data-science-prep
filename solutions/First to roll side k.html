A and B are playing the following game: a number k from 1-6 is chosen, and A and B will toss a die until the first person sees the side k, and that person gets $100. How much is A willing to pay to play first in this game?

We will assume the dice is fair.<br>
We can model this using a geometric distribution.<br>
The probability of winning if you're going first is <br>

$\begin{align}
\sum_{i~odd}^{\infty}(5/6)^{i-1}(1/6)
&= (1/6)(1 + (5/6)^2 + (5/6)^4 + ...)\\
&= (1/6)\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}((5/6)^2)^i \\
&= (1/6)\frac{1}{1-(5/6)^2}\\
&= (1/6)\frac{6^2}{6^2-5^2}\\
&= \frac{6}{36-25}\\
&= \frac{6}{11}
\end{align}$

Thus the expected winnings of the person going first is $100 * (\frac{6}{11}) \approx 54.55$ dollars.<br>
It follows that A would pay up to $4.55 to go first.
